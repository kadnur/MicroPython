# MicroPython Pikachu

## **Project Description**
This is a small & fun MicroPython project aiming to test the ESP32 board BLE connectivity with an Android phone and the use of custom-made libraries to create 128x64 OLED screen animations. Also tested PWM and digital outputs.

Android app was done with the help of good-old App Inventor tool.

BLE + App Inventor connectivity is not very well documented as of 2022, so hopefully you can find this repo as a good reference for doing that.
